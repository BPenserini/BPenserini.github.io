# Capture of the Zhada Basin by the Sutlej River, Northwest Himalayas

Below is a figure showing the distribution of identified knickpoints (i.e., slope breaks along a channel) within the Zhada Basin. Most knickpoints fall into one of three elevation ranges, with knickpoints between 4350-4550m believed to result from rapid, ongoing channel incision in response to capture.
