My research uses geochronology and geospatial datasets to address open questions in the field of tectonic geomorphology. Simply put, tectonic geomorphology is the study how tectonic forces (<i>think earthquakes</i>) interact with processes that erode earth's surface (<i>think rivers</i>) to generate landscapes (<i>think mountain ranges</i>) over thousands to millions of years. During my Ph.D., I investigated the erosional history of the northwest Himalayas as a means to understand how the relationships between tectonic deformation, climate, and surface processes influence mountain building over geomorphic and geologic timescales. 

Below are links to several research questions that I have addressed in my research. All map figures and plots shown on these webpages were created using QGIS 3, Matlab, and Adobe Illustrator.
