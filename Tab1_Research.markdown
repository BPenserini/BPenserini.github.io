My research uses geochronology and geospatial datasets to address open questions in the field of tectonic geomorphology. Simply put, tectonic geomorphology is the study how tectonic forces (<i>think earthquakes</i>) interact with processes that erode earth's surface (<i>think rivers</i>) to generate landscapes (<i>think mountain ranges</i>) over thousands to millions of years. During my Ph.D., I investigated the erosional history of the northwest Himalayas as a means to understand how the relationships between tectonic deformation, climate, and surface processes influence mountain building over geomorphic and geologic timescales. 

Below are links to several research questions that I have addressed in my research. All map figures and plots shown on these webpages were created using QGIS 3, Matlab, and Adobe Illustrator.

# <u>Is fault slip near the Himalayan rangecrest connected to capture of the Zhada Basin?</u>

After inferring that the Sutlej River captured the Zhada basin, I wanted to identify possible mechanisms that could have initiated the event. At the most basic level, drainage capture is driven by an imbalance of erosion rates across a drainage divide. In the case of the Sutlej River, this imbalance appears to result from headward erosion, which is the process by which stream channels elongate as channel heads migrate in the direction opposite from stream flow. Based on geological observations near the capture point, I proposed three possible mechanisms (shown below) that could have generated the headward erosion necessary to initiate capture of the Zhada Basin.

| *Three mechanisms that may have initiated capture of the Zhada Basin. (A) Headward erosion is generated by a previous capture event, whereby the Sutlej captured the Spiti River. At t<sub>1</sub>, incipient drainage capture of the Spiti River occurs, integrating the Spiti drainage into the Sutlej. At t<sub>2</sub>, capture of the Spiti has resulted in increased river discharge and incision in the Sutlej network downstream from the capture point. This generates headward erosion that breaches the drainage divide with the Zhada Basin along one of the Sutlej tributaries. At t<sub>Present</sub>, capture of the Zhada Basin has occurred, resulting in the modern geometry of the Sutlej drainage. (B) Headward erosion is generated by preferential incision into weak rocks. At t<sub>1</sub>, the Zhada Basin is enclosed and brittle faulting has generated weakened rocks along the flanks of the Leo Pargil dome. These fault zones serve as preferential pathways for river incision, leading to headward erosion and entrenchment of stream channels by time t<sub>2</sub>. (C) Headward erosion generated by incision through resistant Greater Himalayan rocks into softer Lesser Himalayan rocks, demonstrated in profile view along the Sutlej River. At t<sub>1</sub>, the downstream portion of the Sutlej has incised through Greater Himalayan rocks, generating a topographic scarp near the contact with Lesser Himalayan rocks. At t<sub>2</sub>, the scarp has propagated upstream and will eventually reach the drainage divide, assisting with drainage capture.* |

To better understand which of these mechanisms could have been responsible for driving drainage capture, I used a technique called (U-Th)/He thermochronometry, or more simply, "He dating." He dating is a method used to determine the amount of time since a rock last cooled below a certain temperature, called the closure temperature. Different minerals within a given rock have different closure temperatures, and if we know or assume how temperature varies with depth below the surface, which known as the geothermal gradient, then we can use different He dates from different minerals (like the apatite shown below) to make a reasonably good estimation of how fast that rock was eroded, or exhumed, to the surface.

Using <i>QTQt</i>, a program that uses Bayesian trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses to generate possible thermal histories from He dates, and <i>age2edot</i>, a program that estimates exhumation rates from He dates, we inferred the history of erosion along the Sutlej River over the past several million years from. Next, we compared the history of erosion inferred from He dates to results from river incision models, where we simulated the incisional response of the Sutlej to drainage capture across several different scenarios corresponding to different potential capture mechanisms, as shown earlier.

Note that the orientation of this map is inverted. (B) Plot of different uplift fields used in model scenarios. We applied two different uplift fields to model simulations to account for uncertainty in modern uplift rates revealed by previous thermochronometric dates and our denudation rates.* |
