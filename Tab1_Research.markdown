For my Master's and PhD research, I used geospatial data to address several open questions in the field of tectonic geomorphology. Simply put, tectonic geomorphology is the study how tectonic forces (<i>think earthquakes</i>) interact with processes that erode earth's surface (<i>think rivers</i>) to generate landscapes (<i>think mountain ranges</i>) over thousands to millions of years. 

Below are several questions that I have addressed in my research. All figures shown here were created using QGIS 3, Matlab, and Adobe Illustrator.

# <u>Was the Zhada Basin captured by the Sutlej River?</u>

For my PhD research, I concentrated on the tectonic geomorphology of the northwest Himalayas. The Himalayas are one of the most studied mountain ranges on Earth, however our understanding of how the mountains and the river systems that drain them have changed over time remains incomplete. For example, several studies have identified portions of river networks that have experienced drainage capture (<i>blue polygons in A above</i>), which is where one river network breaches a divide separating it from another river network, such that the latter is "captured" by the former. The exact mechanism, or mechanisms, that caused these captures remains elusive, preventing us from fully understanding the significance of these events with respect to the evolution of the Himalayas.   

 In my work, I focused on a proposed capture event within the Sutlej River network. Today, the Sutlej River is one of the largest rivers that flows across the Himalayas. The river originates in southern China before flowing through the Zhada Basin, which is a high-elevation sedimentary basin believed to once contain a vast lake. One hypothesis for this transition from a lake to a through-flowing river in the Zhada Basin is that the Sutlej River captured the basin within the past million years. This hypothesis had not been rigorously tested, but if it were the case, then it is likely that the Sutlej River incised across the Himalayan range crest, breaching the existing topographic barrier that helped form the lake.

If we look at a digital elevation model (DEM) of the Zhada Basin, we can begin to address this hypothesis. Below is a figure showing the spatial distribution of identified knickpoints, or slope breaks along a river channel, within the Zhada Basin (<i>A</i>). Most knickpoints are found within one of three elevation ranges, with an abundance of knickpoints between 4350-4550m (<i>orange region in B</i>). It turns out that one prediction of capture is that knickpoints, representing the front of a propagating wave of increased river erosion, are generated upstream from where capture occurred and found at similar elevations. While the knickpoints between 4350-4550m may have resulted from rapid, ongoing river erosion in response to capture, we need to check whether the knickpoint X,Y locations match what would be expected if they were capture-generated.

To test this hypothesis, I wrote several Matlab scripts [(GitHub Link)](https://github.com/BPenserini/KPPropagation) to simulate the expected dynamics of capture-generated knickpoints within the Zhada Basin. In the figure below, you can see that the modeled knickpoint locations match very well with the observed knickpoint locations (modeled propagation distances are, on average, within 2% of observed propagation distances). This suggests that the spatial distribution of observed knickpoints at elevations between 4350-4550m matches what we would expect if these knickpoints were generated by capture of the basin by the Sutlej River. We therefore infer that the Sutlej River did, in fact, capture the Zhada Basin.

In the manuscript, we go into greater detail regarding our methodology and additional geological inferences that allow us to better constrain the magnitude and timing of this event.
