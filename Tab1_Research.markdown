My research uses geochronology and geospatial datasets to address open questions in the field of tectonic geomorphology. Simply put, tectonic geomorphology is the study how tectonic forces (<i>think earthquakes</i>) interact with processes that erode earth's surface (<i>think rivers</i>) to generate landscapes (<i>think mountain ranges</i>) over thousands to millions of years. During my Ph.D., I investigated the erosional history of the northwest Himalayas as a means to understand how the relationships between tectonic deformation, climate, and surface processes influence mountain building over geomorphic and geologic timescales. 

Below are several questions that I have addressed in my research. All map figures and plots shown here were created using QGIS 3, Matlab, and Adobe Illustrator.

# <u>Was the Zhada Basin captured by the Sutlej River?</u>

![Overview Map of Large Capture Events.](./Images/HimalayaCaptureAnalogs_240116b.png) 

The Himalayas are one of the most studied mountain ranges on Earth, however our understanding of how these mountains, and the river systems that drain them, have changed over time remains incomplete. For example, several studies have identified river networks that have experienced drainage capture (<i>blue polygons in A above</i>), which occurs when the drainage divide separating two networks is breached, altering flowpaths such that one network is "captured" by the other. The exact mechanism, or mechanisms, that caused these captures in the Himalayas remains elusive, preventing us from fully understanding the significance of these events with respect to the evolution of the mountain range.   

 In my work, I focused on a proposed capture event within the Sutlej River network. Today, the Sutlej River is one of the largest rivers that crosses the Himalayas. The river originates in southern China before flowing through the Zhada Basin, which is a high-elevation sedimentary basin believed to have once contained a vast lake. One hypothesis for this transition from a lake to a through-flowing river in the Zhada Basin is that the Sutlej River captured the basin within the past million years. This hypothesis had not been rigorously tested, but if it were the case, then it is likely that the Sutlej River incised across the Himalayan range crest, breaching the existing topographic barrier that helped form the lake.

By using at a digital elevation model (DEM) of the Zhada Basin, we can begin to address this hypothesis. Below is a figure showing the spatial distribution of identified knickpoints, or slope breaks, along a river channel within the Zhada Basin (<i>A</i>). Most knickpoints are found within one of three elevation ranges, with an abundance of knickpoints between 4350-4550m above sea level (<i>orange region in B</i>). Two predicted outcomes of drainage capture are: (1) knickpoints, representing the front of a propagating wave of increased river erosion, are generated upstream from where capture occurred and (2) these knickpoints are located at similar elevations. At first glance, it appears the knickpoints between 4350-4550m satisfy these two predictions, however we also need to check whether the knickpoint X,Y locations match what would be expected if they were capture-generated.

To test this hypothesis, I wrote several Matlab scripts [(GitHub Link)](https://github.com/BPenserini/KPPropagation) to automate simulations of the expected dynamics of capture-generated knickpoints within the Zhada Basin. In the figure below, modeled knickpoint locations match very well with the observed knickpoint locations, with modeled knickpoint propagation distances within 2%, on average, of observed propagation distances). This finding suggests that the spatial distribution of observed knickpoints at elevations between 4350-4550m matches what we would expect if these knickpoints were generated by drainage capture, which leads us to infer that the Sutlej River did, in fact, capture the Zhada Basin.

# <u>Is fault slip near the Himalayan rangecrest connected to capture of the Zhada Basin?</u>

After inferring that the Sutlej River captured the Zhada basin, I wanted to identify possible mechanisms that could have initiated the event. At the most basic level, drainage capture is driven by an imbalance of erosion rates across a drainage divide. In the case of the Sutlej River, this imbalance appears to result from headward erosion, which is the process by which stream channels elongate as channel heads migrate in the direction opposite from stream flow. Based on geological observations near the capture point, I proposed three possible mechanisms (shown below) that could have generated the headward erosion necessary to initiate capture of the Zhada Basin.

![Summary of different proposed mechanisms for Sutlej capture via headward erosion.](./Images/CombinedExampleMechanisms_240122c.png)

To better understand which of these mechanisms could have been responsible for driving drainage capture, I used a technique called (U-Th)/He thermochronometry, or more simply, "He dating." He dating is a method used to determine the amount of time since a rock last cooled below a certain temperature, called the closure temperature. Different minerals within a given rock have different closure temperatures, and if we know or assume how temperature varies with depth below the surface, which known as the geothermal gradient, then we can use different He dates from different minerals (like the apatite shown below) to make a reasonably good estimation of how fast that rock was eroded, or exhumed, to the surface.
