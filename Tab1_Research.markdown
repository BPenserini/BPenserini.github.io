My research uses geochronology and geospatial datasets to address open questions in the field of tectonic geomorphology. Simply put, tectonic geomorphology is the study how tectonic forces (<i>think earthquakes</i>) interact with processes that erode earth's surface (<i>think rivers</i>) to generate landscapes (<i>think mountain ranges</i>) over thousands to millions of years.

## Ph.D. Research
During my Ph.D. at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.geol.ucsb.edu/), I investigated the erosional history of the northwest Himalayas as a means to understand how the relationships between tectonic deformation, climate, and surface processes influence mountain building over geomorphic and geologic timescales. Below are links to several research projects I completed during my graduate studies. All map figures and plots shown on these webpages were created using QGIS 3, Matlab, and Adobe Illustrator.

## Master's Research
During my Master's at the [University of Oregon](https://naturalsciences.uoregon.edu/earth-sciences), I developed a new proxy for catchment-averaged erosion rates based on the signature of debris flow scour and incision. I applied this new erosion model within the Oregon Coast Range, which revealed an interesting pattern reflecting the dynamics of the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Below is a link to a more detailed description of the project.
