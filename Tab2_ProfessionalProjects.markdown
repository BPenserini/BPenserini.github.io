# Landslide Volume and Mobility Analysis (U.S. Geological Survey)

As a Pathways Intern for the U.S. Geological Survey, I assembled and analyzed a dataset of landslide characteristics to help improve assessments of long-term risk for wildfire burn areas. I developed a new workflow using density-based clustering (DBSCAN) in ArcGIS Pro to identify landslide source areas, which facilitated exploratory analyses of the relationships between landslide volume and mobility. I conducted exploratory analyses using statistical Python packages (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seablorn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, and SciPy) and assembled them in several Jupyter Notebooks to produce clear, well-documented, and resusable templates.
