title: Have spatial patterns in erosion changed over time in the Northwest Himalayas?
permalink: /Research/ErosionPatterns
---

The Himalayas have been the focus of many studies looking to identify relationships between topography, exposed geologic relationships of different rock units, and the underlying tectonic processes involved in mountain building. These studies have helped established a paradigm for the evolution of the Himalayas, which explains how patterns erosion are intrinsically linked to the evolution of faults and geologic structures underlying the range. However, this paradigm breaks down in the northwest Himalayas, where spatial patterns of topographic relief (<i>the difference between the highest and lowest elevations in a given area</i>), exposed rock units, and erosion rates differ substantially from those in the central Himalayas (<i>near the brown dashed line in the figure below</i>).

Previous studies have also noted two key observations from the spatial patterns of low-temperature thermochronometric dates in the northwest and central Himalayas: (1) [duplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_(geology)) development within the [Lesser Himalayan Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Himalayan_Strata) appears to have migrated westward since the late [Miocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene), and (2) the sharp along-strike change in the patterns of topography, exposed geology, and erosion rates can be attributed to a change in tectonic style, with the transition coinciding with the westward extent of duplex propagation. However, low-temperature thermochronometry cannot resolve the most recent patterns of erosion (i.e., within the past 1 Myr), so it is uncertain whether duplexing has continued to migrate to the west over the past million years. Resolving the pattern of modern erosion rates can help detemine whether duplexing continues to migrate, which is a key test to identify the mechanism(s) that may explain these observations.

In this work, I used cosmogenic <sup>10</sup>Be-derived denudation rates, in conjunction with published thermochronometric dates (i.e., helium and [fission track dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_track_dating)), to better resolve the spatial patterns of erosion in the northwest Himalayas over millennial and million-year timescales and determine whether duplexing continues to migrate westward. To increase the density of denudation rate measurements across our study area, I generated an estimated erosion rate map using a calibrated, empirical relationship between catchment-averaged <sup>10</sup>Be-derived denudation rates and k<sub>snQ</sub>, a [newly developed proxy for erosion rates.](https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.aaz3166).

Erosion rates mapped using the relationship between millennial denudation rates and k<sub>snQ</sub> exhibit a similar spatiotemporal pattern to exhumation rates determined from low-temperature thermochronometric dates (<i>see figure below</i>), suggesting that duplexing has not migrated over the past several million years. Of the mechanisms we evaluated, only asynchronous ramp formation and advection within the orogenic wedge ([Mercier et al., 2017](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Beek-2/publication/317326150_Do_along-strike_tectonic_variations_in_the_Nepal_Himalaya_reflect_different_stages_in_the_accretion_cycle_Insights_from_numerical_modeling/links/5b8be89492851c1e12430617/Do-along-strike-tectonic-variations-in-the-Nepal-Himalaya-reflect-different-stages-in-the-accretion-cycle-Insights-from-numerical-modeling.pdf) independently explains both the sharp changes observed in our study area and the apparent migration of duplexing along the strike of the range. <b>Our results represent a key contribution to the growing literature demonstrating the utility of k<sub>snQ</sub> to assess regional patterns of erosion rates and emphasize the importance of accounting for spatially variable precipitation when using channel steepness as a proxy for denudation rate.</b>

| *(A) Map of estimated erosion rates and exhumation rates from low-temperature thermochronometry for the transitional region between the northwest and central Himalaya. Estimated erosion rates decrease sharply from >1 mm/yr south of the Rohtang Pass to <0.4 mm/yr to the north, consistent with the pattern of observed thermochronometric dates. (B) Barbed drainages (blue) in tributaries to the Beas River are consistent with westward divide migration, which I suspect resulted from breaching of the Lesser Himalayan Sequence to the east.* |
