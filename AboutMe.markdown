# Who am I?
Hi, I'm Brian! <b>I am a geoscientist specializing in quantitative geomorphology, geographical information systems (GIS), and environmental data analysis.</b> Most recently, I graduated with my Ph.D. in Earth Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), where I used geochronological and remotely sensed datasets to address several hypotheses regarding the interactions between tectonics and erosion in the northwestern Himalayas. I also hold a Master's degree (M.S. Geological Sciences) from the University of Oregon, and a Bachelor's degree (B.S. Geology) from Caltech.

As a professional, I take pride in my ability to work with technical and non-technical audiences, maintain successful relationships with internal and external clients, and receive and implement constructive feedback. Between my Master's and Ph.D. programs, I worked in the environmental consulting industry for three years. During this period of my career, I was extremely fortunate to work with several great mentors who have helped me refine these soft skills and shape who I am today.

 Outside of my work, I enjoy running, going to baseball games, and spending time with my pets.
