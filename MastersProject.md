title: What can debris flow erosion tell us about crustal dynamics?

One of the most widely exploited principles in tectonic geomorphology is that the slope of fluvial channels (i.e., river channels) will adjust over time to maintain a balance between the rate of rock uplift and the channel incision rate. If you've ever gone hiking in the mountains, odds are that some point you saw a fast flowing river that presumably had a steep channel bed. Now think about a meandering river like the Missouri River, which runs through the Great Plains. The bed of the Missouri is relatively flat, just like the surrounding topography. In mountains, the rates of rock uplift (i.e., the rate at which rocks undergo vertical motion, usually in response to tectonic processes) are high relative to rock uplift rates within tectonically quiescent, flat-lying regions like the Great Plains, and this is reflected in the river geometry. Using this principle, geomorphologists often use channel slope as a proxy for erosion and rock uplift rates, assuming erosion and uplift are perfectly balanced.

This principle works well in areas where this assumption is valid, however there are many steep landscapes where rivers only represent a small proportion of that landscape. Therefore, this proxy becomes less useful as estimates of erosion/uplift rates are restricted to areas where rivers are present. This is the case for the Oregon Coast Range, where over 80% of the valley network is generated by episodic debris flows, rather than rivers.
